# Medical-Chatbot

Medical Chatbot
This project is a Medical Chatbot built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The chatbot utilizes Google Gemini API to generate responses based on user queries.

Features:
User-friendly chat interface

Real-time message exchange

API integration with Google Gemini for AI-driven medical responses

Error handling for API failures

Loading indicator while fetching responses

Technologies Used:
Frontend: React, Axios, CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express, Google Gemini API

Deployment: Vercel (for frontend), Localhost/Cloud for backend

How It Works:
The user enters a medical-related question.

The message is sent to the backend via an API request.

The backend processes the request and queries the Google Gemini API.

A response is generated and sent back to the frontend.

The chatbot displays the response in the chat window.

This chatbot serves as a helpful tool for answering basic medical-related queries but should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.
